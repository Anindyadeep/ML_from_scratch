# ML_from_scratch
Learning and rediscovering ML from total scratch

## what are the things available now:
```
Regression:
        1. Linear Regression (one or multiple variable)
        2. Polynoimial Regression
        3. Ridge Regression
        4. Lasso Regression
        5. ElasticNet Regression
        6. Polynomial Ridge Regression
        7. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) [Regression]
        
        TODO:
        1. Support Vector Machines (regression)
        2. Xg Boost (regression)
        
```

```
Classification:
        1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
        2. Logistic Regression (can work for both binary and multi class)

        TODO:
        1. Support Vector Machines
        2. Naive Bayes
        3. Decison Trees
        4. Random Forests
        5. Ada Boost
        6. Xg boost
        
```

Other Different algorithms such as Decision Trees, 
Naive Bias, and all other unsupervised along with deep
learning algorithms will be comming soon, so stay tuned.
